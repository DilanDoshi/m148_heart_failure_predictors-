# Overview  
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally, responsible for an estimated 17.9 million deaths each year—approximately 31% of all deaths worldwide. Heart failure, a common consequence of CVDs, poses a major health burden that requires timely prediction and intervention. This project utilizes a dataset containing 12 clinical features to develop a machine learning model for predicting mortality due to heart failure. Early identification of high-risk patients through such predictive modeling can support proactive disease management and improve patient outcomes.

**Goal**

Predict whether a patient with heart failure will die during the follow-up period (`DEATH_EVENT` = 1 vs 0) based on 12 clinical variables.

**Type of problem**

- Supervised learning
- Binary classification (DEATH vs SURVIVAL)
- Small tabular dataset (299 rows, 13 columns including target)
