# Overview  
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally, responsible for an estimated 17.9 million deaths each year—approximately 31% of all deaths worldwide. Heart failure, a common consequence of CVDs, poses a major health burden that requires timely prediction and intervention. This project utilizes a dataset containing 12 clinical features to develop a machine learning model for predicting mortality due to heart failure. Early identification of high-risk patients through such predictive modeling can support proactive disease management and improve patient outcomes.
